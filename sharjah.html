                <p>Sharjah, the third-largest emirate in the United Arab Emirates, encompasses an area of approximately 2,590 square kilometers. It is celebrated for its rich cultural heritage, often referred to as the "Cultural Capital of the Arab World." Sharjah's history is deeply rooted in the preservation of Arabic culture, arts, and traditions.

                <p>The ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, has been a prominent advocate for culture and education. His reign has seen the establishment of numerous museums, galleries, and cultural festivals, making Sharjah a haven for artists, historians, and literature enthusiasts. The emirate's commitment to cultural endeavors is further exemplified by its recognition as the UNESCO World Book Capital in 2019.
